## Emerald Coast 0.9.0c
- Re-tagged collision near the second checkpoint, previously set to "wall" collision which made certain speedrun skips annoying.
- Fixed rotation of the left dashpanel in the upper tunnel after the waterfalls so Sonic won't miss the spring anymore.
- Temporarily removed wrongly placed object boulders next to the tunnel teleporter.
- Included empty save files to prevent both returning to White Space from the pause menu & potentially breaking the user's default save file AND having certain skills enabled by mistake. Starting the level requires pressing the New Game option now.

## Emerald Coast 0.9.0b
- Require Better FXPipeline as a dependency.
- Classic Sonic assets (falling anim, spindash particle edit) are now an append archive.
- Added patch "Disable Brightness Adjustment."
- Fixed first-launch text box not showing up for most people (if you saw it already it'll happen one more time, sorry!)
- Removed unpacked PFDs. Oops!

## Emerald Coast 0.9.0a
- Hotfix warning you if you don't have HE1ML installed, forcing the game to quit.

## Emerald Coast 0.9.0
- Initial beta
